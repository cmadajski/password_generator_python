# Password Generator

This is a basic password generator written in Python. It generates a string of alphanumeric characters and is guaranteed to have at
least one special character (characters with ASCII values between 33 and 43 inclusive).

The default string length is 24, but a custom length can be specified via an integer argument like ```python3 passgen.py 32``` for a 32
character password.
